					<p>This site was born out of frustration of the currently existing graphing tools.
					They either have complicated syntax or needs to be compiled (which in the end 
					doesn't even work).</p>

					<h2>Libraries</h2>
					<p>These libraries are used by graphing.it:</p>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Rapha&euml;l</a> 
							- svg library, makes the code for drawing a lot simpler.
						</li>
						<li><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a> - 
						Takes care of sending the input data to javascript.
						</li>
						<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jquery</a> - more or less required by knockout. </li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery template plugin</a> - same as above.</li>
